        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="subtext">
            In this hearty vegetarian dish, an umami-rich mushroom sauce combines 
            with tarragon-tossed tagliatelle pasta. Red miso and mild portobellos 
            ground the flavors in earthy richness that contrasts well with a 
            finishing spoonful of chive-seasoned ricotta cheese. Tagliatelle is an 
            egg noodle similar in shape to fettuccine, but with a finer texture and 
            richer flavor. We used dried tagliatelle, which is sold bundled in nests. 
            Refer to the package directions for cooking times.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="subtext">
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
            <li><strong>¼ cup</strong> finely chopped fresh chives</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and ground black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>8 ounces</strong> dried tagliatelle</li>
            <li><strong>4 tablespoons (½ stick)</strong> salted butter, divided</li>
            <li><strong>2 pounds</strong> portobello mushroom caps, gills removed, quartered and sliced ¼ inch thick</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> medium shallots, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> dry white wine</li>
            <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> red miso</li>
            <li><strong>½ cup</strong> lightly packed fresh tarragon, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="subtext">
            <li>
                In a small bowl, whisk together the ricotta, chives and ¼ teaspoon 
                each salt and pepper. Set aside. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of 
                water to a boil. Add the pasta and 2 tablespoons salt and cook until 
                al dente. Reserve 2 cups of the cooking water, drain the pasta and 
                return it to the pot. Add 1 tablespoon of the butter and ½ cup of 
                the reserved cooking water; toss to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons 
                of the butter until foaming. Add the mushrooms, shallots and ¼ teaspoon 
                each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until the mushrooms have released 
                their moisture and are well browned, about 10 minutes. Add the wine, 
                scrape up any browned bits and simmer until almost evaporated, about 
                5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the remaining 1½ cups reserved cooking water, bring to a simmer and 
                cook over medium-high until the mixture has thickened, about 10 minutes. 
                Off heat, stir in the miso and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Taste and 
                season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tarragon to the pasta and toss, then transfer to a serving bowl. 
                Spoon the mushroom mixture over the pasta. Serve dolloped with the 
                ricotta mixture and drizzled with olive oil.
