        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            In this hearty vegetarian dish, an umami-rich mushroom sauce combines 
            with tarragon-tossed tagliatelle pasta. Red miso and mild portobellos 
            ground the flavors in earthy richness that contrasts well with a 
            finishing spoonful of chive-seasoned ricotta cheese. Tagliatelle is an 
            egg noodle similar in shape to fettuccine, but with a finer texture and 
            richer flavor. We used dried tagliatelle, which is sold bundled in nests. 
            Refer to the package directions for cooking times.
