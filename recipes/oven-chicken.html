        <!-- Ingredients -->
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Â½ cup</strong> butter</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> onion, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> dried basil</li>
            <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> red pepper flakes</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> salt</li>
            <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> ground black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>3 pounds</strong> chicken thighs</li>
            <li><strong>1 pound</strong> linguine pasta</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> (10 ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Directions -->
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place butter into a 9x13-inch baking dish and set in oven while it 
                preheats until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir onion, basil, red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into 
                melted butter. Add chicken, turning to coat with onion mixture and 
                ending skin-side up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the 
                juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                Remove chicken from dish. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine 
                at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix spinach into onion-butter sauce until thoroughly mixed; add linguine 
                and Parmesan cheese, tossing to combine. Place chicken on top of pasta. 
            </li>
        </ol>
